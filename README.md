# 🛌💤 Sleep Disorders and Heart Disease: A Machine Learning Exploration 💓🔍

This project explores the intriguing relationship between sleep disorders and heart disease using advanced machine learning techniques. We delve into two comprehensive datasets: the Heart Disease dataset and the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset.

## 📚 Datasets

We use two datasets in this project:

1. **🩺 Heart Disease Dataset:**
    * This dataset contains 389 records of male patients data with 12 features. The target variable is the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients. The dataset is available on Kaggle.

2. **🛌 Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset:**
    * This dataset contains 1,000 records of patients data with 12 features. The target variable is the presence or absence of sleep disorders in patients. The dataset is available on Kaggle.

The datasets are located in the [Datasets](./Datasets) directory.

## 📓 Notebooks

We have three main notebooks in this project:

1. [🔬 Project.ipynb](./Project.ipynb): This is the main notebook for the project. It includes data loading, preprocessing, feature integration, and machine learning model training.

2. [🧪 hypothesisTesting.ipynb](./hypothesisTesting.ipynb): This notebook includes the hypothesis testing for the project.

3. [📊 Graphical Analysis.ipynb](./GraphicalAnalysis.ipynb): This notebook includes the graphical analysis for the project.

## 🤔 Hypothesis

The hypothesis of this project is that a male patient with a sleep disorder has a higher risk of heart disease.

## 🤖 Machine Learning

The project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict sleep disorders in the Cardio dataset. The predicted values are then integrated with the Cardio dataset to create a new dataset.

## 📈 Results

The results of the project are saved in the [Result.csv](./Datasets/Result.csv) file in the Datasets directory.

We hope you find this project insightful and informative. Happy exploring! 🚀
